# SpiceWay

Spicetify custom css using pywal to match your wallpaper

# Installation

Just copy manually or run the installer:

```
./install.sh
```

# Usage
To be fair idk how to run it NORMAL way but:

1. Create script for it or run it manually from the terminal:
```spicetify watch -s ~/.config/wal/templates/color.ini```

2. Restart spotify every 'pywal' (XDDD)


!!!Importante
